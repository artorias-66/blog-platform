5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Database Setup

### Option 1: Local PostgreSQL
1. Install PostgreSQL locally
2. Create a database named `blog_platform`
3. Update your `.env.local` with the connection string

### Option 2: Hosted Database (Recommended)
1. **Neon** (Free tier available): [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. **Supabase** (Free tier available): [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
3. **Railway** (Free tier available): [railway.app](https://railway.app)

## API Structure

The application uses tRPC for type-safe APIs with the following routers:

- **Posts Router** (`/api/trpc/posts`)
  - `list` - Get all posts with optional category filtering
  - `bySlug` - Get a single post by slug
  - `create` - Create a new post
  - `update` - Update an existing post
  - `delete` - Delete a post

- **Categories Router** (`/api/trpc/categories`)
  - `list` - Get all categories
  - `create` - Create a new category
  - `update` - Update an existing category
  - `delete` - Delete a category

## Database Schema

### Posts Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `title` - Post title
- `slug` - URL-friendly identifier
- `content` - Post content (Markdown)
- `published` - Publication status
- `createdAt` - Creation timestamp
- `updatedAt` - Last update timestamp

### Categories Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `name` - Category name
- `slug` - URL-friendly identifier
- `description` - Category description
- `createdAt` - Creation timestamp
- `updatedAt` - Last update timestamp

### Posts to Categories (Many-to-Many)
- `postId` - Foreign key to posts
- `categoryId` - Foreign key to categories

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

1.  **Create a new "Project"** on Vercel and connect your GitHub repository.

2.  **Configure the service:**
    *   **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
    *   **Start Command**: `npm start`

3.  **Add Environment Variables:**
    *   `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string (you can create a free Postgres instance on Render).
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: Set this to the value of your Vercel deployment URL.

4.  **Deploy!** Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application.

5.  **Database Migrations:** After the first deployment, you may need to run migrations. You can do this by connecting to your Vercel deployment via the shell and running `npm run db:migrate`.

## Tech Choices & Rationale

During this project, I made a few key technical decisions:

-   **Content Editor**: I opted for a **Markdown editor** instead of a full rich-text editor. This saved significant development time while still providing a great writing experience.
-   **API Layer**: I chose **tRPC** because its end-to-end type safety with Next.js is a huge productivity booster and helps prevent bugs between the frontend and backend.
-   **ORM**: I went with **Drizzle ORM**. It's lightweight, offers great performance, and its SQL-like syntax feels very intuitive.
-   **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** was a clear choice for quickly building a clean and responsive UI without writing a lot of custom CSS.

## Time Spent

I spent approximately **14 hours** on this project over the course of a week, from initial setup to final deployment and documentation.
