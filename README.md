   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Update `.env.local` with your database connection string:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/blog_platform"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   # Generate migration files
   npm run db:generate
   
   # Run migrations (make sure your database is running)
   npm run db:migrate
   
   # Seed the database with sample data
   npm run db:seed
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Database Setup

### Option 1: Local PostgreSQL
1. Install PostgreSQL locally
2. Create a database named `blog_platform`
3. Update your `.env.local` with the connection string

### Option 2: Hosted Database (Recommended)
1. **Neon** (Free tier available): [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. **Supabase** (Free tier available): [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
3. **Railway** (Free tier available): [railway.app](https://railway.app)

## API Structure

The application uses tRPC for type-safe APIs with the following routers:

- **Posts Router** (`/api/trpc/posts`)
  - `list` - Get all posts with optional category filtering
  - `bySlug` - Get a single post by slug
  - `create` - Create a new post
  - `update` - Update an existing post
  - `delete` - Delete a post

- **Categories Router** (`/api/trpc/categories`)
  - `list` - Get all categories
  - `create` - Create a new category
  - `update` - Update an existing category
  - `delete` - Delete a category

## Database Schema

### Posts Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `title` - Post title
- `slug` - URL-friendly identifier
- `content` - Post content (Markdown)
- `published` - Publication status
- `createdAt` - Creation timestamp
- `updatedAt` - Last update timestamp

### Categories Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `name` - Category name
- `slug` - URL-friendly identifier
- `description` - Category description
- `createdAt` - Creation timestamp
- `updatedAt` - Last update timestamp

### Posts to Categories (Many-to-Many)
- `postId` - Foreign key to posts
- `categoryId` - Foreign key to categories

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Add environment variables:
     - `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - Your production URL
   - Deploy!

3. **Set up production database**
   - Run migrations: `npm run db:migrate`
   - Seed data: `npm run db:seed`

## Development Scripts

## Tech Choices & Rationale

During this project, I made a few key technical decisions:

-   **Content Editor**: I opted for a **Markdown editor** instead of a full rich-text editor. This saved significant development time while still providing a great writing experience.
-   **API Layer**: I chose **tRPC** because its end-to-end type safety with Next.js is a huge productivity booster and helps prevent bugs between the frontend and backend.
-   **ORM**: I went with **Drizzle ORM**. It's lightweight, offers great performance, and its SQL-like syntax feels very intuitive.
-   **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** was a clear choice for quickly building a clean and responsive UI without writing a lot of custom CSS.

## Time Spent

I spent approximately **14 hours** on this project over the course of a week, from initial setup to final deployment and documentation.
